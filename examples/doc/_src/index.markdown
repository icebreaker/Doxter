Documentation
=============
Absolutely stunning **documentation** with as little effort as possible benefiting from
the simplicity of [Markdown](#).

Classes
-------
* [HelloWorld in Python](hello_py.html)
* [HelloWorld in C++](hello_cpp.html)

Features
--------
Nice and rich syntax highlighting:

```python
def HelloWorld():
	print('Hello World')
```

```cpp
class HelloWorld
{
	public:
		HelloWorld(void) {}
}
```

Or just *pre*:

	$ whoami

Nice quotes:

> Now, if Lahaina Divers just realized that they should tell people from Northern Europe 
> to show up at 7:30 (instead of 7AM for the tardy people who don't have that Germanic 
> "Ve vill be on time" mentality), and if the pull requests I got had been a bit higher quality,
> it would all have been perfect.
